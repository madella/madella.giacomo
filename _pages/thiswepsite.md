<!-- This site reflects my curiosity and personality. Since I had never developed a full blog before and didn’t have time to manage a server, I opted for the simplest solution: Jekyll and GitHub Pages. As I worked on it, I explored how it functions and experimented in my editing space. The result is a personal site that is professional and straightforward, yet uniquely customized with personal touches and a few easter eggs. It truly represents my signature style. -->
Since I had never developed a full-fledged blog before and didn’t have the time to manage a server for hosting, I started with the simplest solution available: Jekyll and GitHub Pages. 
I understand it’s not the cleanest solution for a software engineer, but since I maintain this in my free time and have a variety of interests, I prefer to keep things at a good level of simplicity.

As I began working on it, I delved deeply into how it works and, through experimentation in my editing space, I achieved what I wanted—a personal site that is professional and straightforward, yet uniquely customized with some personal touches (and a few easter eggs). It’s like my signature, making it distinctly my own.
