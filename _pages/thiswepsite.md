This site is a true reflection of who I am and my curiosity. Since I had never developed a full-fledged blog before and didn’t have the time to manage a server for hosting, I started with the simplest solution available: Jekyll and GitHub Pages. As I began working on it, I delved deeply into how it works and, through experimentation in my editing space, I achieved what I wanted—a personal site that is professional and straightforward, yet uniquely customized with some personal touches (and a few easter eggs). It’s like my signature, making it distinctly my own.
