<cite>CyberChallenge.IT</cite> --- a training program for young talents between 16 and 24 years old, is the main Italian initiative to identify, attract, recruit, and place the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.
Participation does not require expertise in programming, but rather a strong passion, commitment, and curiosity in scientific and technological disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Logical skills, problem-solving, communication abilities, and most importantly, a strong desire to learn are also needed.
