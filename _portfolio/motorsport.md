MotorSport is a Bolognaâ€™s university student association that takes part in various Formula SAE events, participating to MotoStudent competitions all over the world. In particular I joined the F1tenth race in Philadelphia and Rimini, by being in charge of the software infrastructure division for the AI section of our driverless car.
