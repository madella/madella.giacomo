The motorsport project has been a significant part of my academic journey. Since I've always enjoyed hands-on experiences, I wanted to take on an extracurricular project. When I joined, it was a relatively new initiative founded a few years prior by a group of ambitious individuals who aimed to establish the driverless team at the University of Bologna without any external assistance.

Over the years, we consistently maintained a team of 12 to 18 members, peaking at 20 shortly before I left. My role was clearly defined from the beginning: software infrastructure. Despite this clear position, the nature of my work changed quite frequently. Practically, I was responsible for integrating and stabilizing all the components produced by the other teams to ensure they worked together seamlessly in theunderlying Robot Operating System (ROS).

As the years progressed, our focus shifted from simulators (Gazebo) to our first physical vehicle (F1TENTH), which we took to compete in Philadelphia (US) just a month after acquiring it. In the initial phase, I worked on creating a stable and user-friendly testing environment for those developing autonomous driving algorithms (Perception, Motion Planning, Computer Vision). In the latter part of my time with the team, given the limited time to compete, I also assisted my teammate focused on autonomous driving algorithms, working with Python on various tools like Reinforcement Learning, Deterministic algorithms, data processing, SLAM, and more. Finally, I spent my last few months helping with local competitions, such as those in Rimini (IT), and facilitating the transfer of information..

_MotorSport is a Bolognaâ€™s university student association that takes part in various Formula SAE events, participating to MotoStudent competitions all over the world. In particular I joined the F1tenth race in Philadelphia and Rimini, by being in charge of the software infrastructure division for the AI section of our driverless car._

#### Since the team is still active and all the software is proprietary, I cannot share any code related to this experience.
