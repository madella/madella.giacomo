Hi! I’m Giacomo, and I’m passionate about a whole bunch of things: technology, electronics, computer science, physics, and astronomy. I’m extremely curious, and that’s why I love learning new things all the time, whether it’s diving into a new project or exploring a completely different field.

I’m not someone who enjoys writing about myself* — I’d rather roll up my sleeves and get things done.

When I’m not working on my PhD, you’ll probably find me working on new projects, 3D printing, listening to music, or studying new fields.

In the Projects section [DANGER, NERD STUFF](/projects/){: .btn--small .btn .btn--danger}, you’ll find some of the projects I’ve completed over the past few years. I’ll do my best to include them all and keep them updated.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to work together or just say hello. I’d love to connect!

<span style="font-size: 0.2em;">*And just in case you’re wondering, I’ve obviously used generative AI to polish up this introduction.</span>
